# Turtle-Race
NOTE: The idea behind this project comes from Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp, although all the code comes from me. 

Simple GUI made using the Turtle library in Python. Turtles are aligned to the left of the screen and race to the right until they reach x = 200 pixels, in which case the game terminates and a winner is declared.
